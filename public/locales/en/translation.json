All parts of the puzzle have been completed by the Turkish Citizenship Act and its recently issued Executive Regulations. The Turkish Government has already begun to receive applications from investors following the purchase of properties conforming to the Turkish Nationality law. The new Turkish nationality law included important amendments to obtain Turkish citizenship, including the decision to grant Turkish citizenship after buying a property worth $ 250 thousand, after it was $ 1 million in the previous resolution. The following is a review of all the papers and documents required for Turkish citizenship in return for real estate investment for the owner of the property and his wife and children under the age of 18 years, based on practical experiences by the legal team of Imtilak Real Estate, where many Turkish citizenship and residency applications has been submitted, and Turkish nationality has already been granted to some of our dear customers during a short period of not more than two months, due mainly to the completion of all required documents, along with the expertise of the after sales team of our company.",
